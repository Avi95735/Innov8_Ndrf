    <h1>NDRF: Natural Disaster Response Force</h1>
    <br>
    <p><i>National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)</i> is an Indian specialized force constituted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.</p>
    <br>
    The responsibility of managing disasters in India is that of the state governments. <i>The ‘Nodal Ministry’</i> in the central government for management of natural disasters is the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
    <br>
    When 'calamities of severe nature' occur, the Central Government is responsible for providing aid and assistance to the affected state, including deploying, at the State's request, Armed Forces, Central Paramilitary Forces, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and such communication, air, and other assets as are available and needed.
    <br>
    <p><b>National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)</b> is under the National Disaster Management Authority. The head of the NDRF is designated as Director General. The Director Generals of NDRF are IPS officers on deputation from Indian police organizations. The Director General is a three-star officer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The NDRF is led by a Director General and also has several Inspector Generals (IG) and Deputy IGs, who are flag officers and wear badges of rank.</p>

    The NDRF teams were deployed in Assam to tackle the annual flood situation. The force carried out rescue operations, evacuating stranded people and providing them with essential relief materials.<br>
    NDRF was instrumental in minimizing the loss of life during the cyclone that hit Odisha. The force was involved in preemptive evacuations, search and rescue operations, and distribution of relief materials.<br>
    The NDRF teams were quick to respond to the earthquake that struck Himachal Pradesh. They carried out search and rescue operations, helping to locate and save trapped individuals.<br>
    The NDRF has been actively involved in rescue efforts in Bharuch district, specifically in Nikora Village. The force saved 105 people stranded in low-lying areas and relocated them to safety in collaboration with the civil administration. This operation was particularly challenging due to the water level being above the danger mark.</p>
